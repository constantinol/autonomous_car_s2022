ultrasoniccalibration.ino can be used to measure the data from the ultrasonic sensor. Just plug it in to the arduino nano, open the console, and place a large flat object in front of the sensors to detect data. Some data may jump around. We will edit those numbers to be ignored.

maincode.ino has the current code, which was modified by us. It will have further changes as the current math does not work.
